# point-loma-fll
Point Loma First Lego League

This project contains all of the documentation and code for the Point Loma First Lego League team #51013.

## Download software

1. [EV3 Programming](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ev3-programming/9mv2s8n4f19t)

This is the software we used in 2019 to program the robot brick/controller.  

2. [EV3 Classroom LEGO Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ev3-classroom-lego-education/9p8sjvzm63sz)

This is optional, but provides additional tutorials and allows the girls to use Scratch to program, which they may be familiar with from school.

3. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

"git" is configuration control software.  We'll use it to share our code with each other.  GitHub Desktop will allow you to download the latest code and share your updates with the team.

## Get the existing code

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

2. "Fork" [the repository](https://github.com/austinmroczek/point-loma-fll).  
   
Go to [the repository](https://github.com/austinmroczek/point-loma-fll).  Click "Fork" in the top right corner of the screen.  This makes your own copy of the main repository on the GitHub server, so you can make changes to the code independently from the rest of the team.

3. "Clone" your repository.

Open the GitHub Desktop application.  Go to File > Clone Repository and pick point-loma-fll.  This makes a copy of your repository on your computer.  Note the "local path" where the files are going to be stored.  

## Save changes to the code

Use the EV3 application to create or modify code for the robot.  Save the file when you're done.  

In GitHub Desktop, it should note that you have made changes to one or more files.  "Commit" those changes to your repository by adding a note about your changes and then clicking "Commit to master".

Use GitHub Desktop to "push" the changes back to GitHub using the blue "push origin" button.  Now the changed files are in your repository on the GitHub server.

## Share your code with the team

With GitHub you recommend new code to a team by submitting a "pull request."  You are asking the team to pull your new code into the project.

Go to your repository on GitHub at https://github.com/your_username/point-loma-fll.  Near the top of the page you should see a note that "this branch is 1 commit ahead".  Click on "pull request" just to the right of that.  Enter a note about the changes you made that is detailed enough for other team members to understand.

Next Coach Austin will have to accept the changes into the main repository.

## Updating the team code

When other team members changes to the code are accepted by Coach Austin, you will need to "pull" the latest changes using GitHub Desktop.
